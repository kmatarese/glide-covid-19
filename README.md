Glide COVID-19
==============

This is an example repo showing how one can use `glide` to sync/process data related
to the COVID-19 outbreak. 

The scripts directory has examples that pull from the following sources:

- [Johns Hopkins COVID-19 data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
- [New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)
- [COVID Tracking Project](http://covidtracking.com/)
- [Starschema COVID-19 Data](https://github.com/starschema/COVID-19-data)

The output is stored in the data directory. It is not currently being updated
in an automated fashion.
